SLOWLY - Make Global Friends,Nice app but something has to be done like sending images having video call,7/9/2019 0:58
SLOWLY - Make Global Friends,I enjoy the purposeful slowdown as finding people is as easy as the dating apps so not as much of a hassle or expense of finding a real pen pal but the slowdown means that you want to say more than just hi that you want to give enough detail or respect someone letter enough to write something worth the wait,10/8/2020 19:40
SLOWLY - Make Global Friends,Hardly any response to letters written if u arent a female then your chances are zero just like dating apps have created the rigged system,6/18/2019 22:42
SLOWLY - Make Global Friends,Great Community,9/9/2019 20:16
