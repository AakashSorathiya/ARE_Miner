doordash,"i gave doordash a chance a few years ago and was severely disappointed. for some reason, six orders in a row were canceled without telling me and most recently (about 2 years since iÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â™ve last used the app), my credit card info was stolen and used to by $112 worth of bbq in a different state. 

i immediately called my bank to cancel the card, cancel the charge, etc and then called doordash to let them know my account was compromised. i spoke to a very nice woman who pulled up my info, refunded the $112, and promptly deleted my account. 

the next day, that ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚ÂœrefundedÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â money was gone from my account and i had 3 emails saying that i needed to provide bank statements showing that i was indeed scammed.

doordash,"i have ordered from doordash exactly twice. both orders were screwed up.  in trying to get a refund for missing items, i spent over 20 minutes chatting with a rep.  at the end of which, i was told my refund would be credited back to my card.

ubereats,"i usually  order from work, so i placed an order thinking my location was on. within 2 minutes of hitting place order i canceled. in tried to change location and make exact same order... but realized location was still wrong. son within 4 minutes i canceled 2 orders. 

i never got a order confirmation or restaurant recovering, accepting, preparing... nothing. so i assumed it was all set. finally i made the correct order and location.

i never checked my credit card statement since my 2 orders said canceled. well a month later i get my bank statement and both orders which were exactly the same and placed and ordered within 4 minutes was on there. 

if it had n one of the orders i would have been less mad... or if i had known i was going charged i work have picked up the order!!!

after talking to multiple people from uber customer services they said they can only refund within 7 days..... and i should have f my statement. but i had trust since they said canceled. 

for such a large company to not refund my $.... and their system clearly messed up the cancel really puts a bad taste in my mouth.

i will never use or recommend this company for anyone. i work in a hotel and we recommend services all the time and i will not recommend them.",11/11/2019 17:37

want to reward your patrons with a discount for referrals, actually 
implement it into the app.. i never received any sort of discount for 
bringing people on board. now i am having to apologize for the lack of

in my first complaint, i told them about very incorrect charges. my order has always been $19.92(including a 20% tip) and was charged for exactly double of that, $39.84. thatÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â™s strange iÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â™m of itself. i got a price breakdown from the customer associate and they assured me that the extra cost may have been from pre authorization charges. this is not true as i received an email receipt dictating that  i was charged $39.84. this is reflected in my chase bank statement.

i complained a second timed, informing them of this and was informed that they would be ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Âœhappy to breakdown my charges.ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â i quickly realized that they were trying to give me the run around. i readied my third complaint with pictures of my previous orders where i was only charged $19.92, the outstanding charge of $38.94 and how it did not add up, a price breakdown by a previous associate that clearly added up to $16.60 (excluding tip), and finally my receipt that charged me $38.94. before submitting my email, i added an addendum that warned if they did not take my email seriously i would have to consider them to be scammers.

 i was met with the identical response that i got from my second complaint.

 if you have an issue, there is  absolutely no reason to contact customer service. having contacted them 3 different times, i can assure you that they have a system that analyzes your complaint and regurgitates something that fits the script.

in addition, there is no other way to contact postmates besides through email support. this is clearly set up so that postmates can give as little effort as possible.

grubhub,grubhub & uber eats are overcharging you when you use your debit card i was missing $4 pay attention to your recent transactions on your bank statements and/or debit card transactions if you don't get transaction alerts check your account activities immediately. they ask for 7 different things for proof when you only need the initial price and overcharges they hope you don't see it or get so frustrated that you give up trying to get your monies back so that they can keep it. #bewareofscammers!!,8/14/2019 9:55

postmates,"i am literally appalled at the quality of service i've received. 

i made 3 orders over a week period. i was charged for each of those orders, and the payments were processed.

a week later, i am charged again for those three orders, all at once. they double charged me for three orders! this was over $60.

this overdrew my account, and i was subsequently charged four ""returned item"" fees, $35.00 each, a total of $140.00. including the overcharges, $204.33. over $200. 

so naturally i contact postmates as soon as i notice, assuming i will be refunded and it's all just a big mistake. they don't have a phone line, by the way. 

i sent a very long email full of screenshots of my bank statements and postmates orders, detailing everything that happened. 

i get a literal paragraph long response essentially saying, ""those double charges were pre-authorization fees."" 

no explanation, no apology, no trying to work with me. 

first of all, how is it a pre-auth if it comes after my account has already been charged? how is a pre-auth charging me over $50 for one order? 

i replied, and got no response. 

my bank (boa) took care of it, refunding everything, and i'm so grateful for their service. 

no help from postmates. 

it's not the mistake that pisses me off. accidents happen (although, seeing all these reviews makes it seem like it's a pretty common occurrence). 

it's the service i received. if i'm spending $25 on $13 worth of food with your company, the least you can do is pretend to care about your customers.

please beware. what they are doing is borderline criminal and fraudulent.",12/23/2015 17:24

two weeks later i noticed the charge in my bank statement. i contacted them again and they refused to correct the matter because 7 days had passed. 

the restaurant failed to prepare my food within the time given at the time of purchase.

the delivery person failed to ensure that they had received my complete order for the restaurant.

postmates,"i used to love this app and would use it regularly to get food from my favorite restaurants delivered to my house. unfortunately i will never use it again as this company has repeatedly demonstrated an utter lack of customer service, and a penchant for committing unethical business practices. beware: if your order is incorrect or missing items, postmates will not fix the issue, and they will keep all of the money you paid, even if you back up your claim with bank statements, receipts, and food tickets pertaining to the order and proving your case. in reply to an email i sent requesting a credit for a missing item, they blatantly lied and stated i had been credited, when all of the records that i meticulously keep indicated otherwise, that i was charged 100% of the original amount. i showed them the initial bank charge, the same bank charge once it posted, and a ticket showing the date and missing item, and still they refused to help. in their email they told me to stop bothering them about the same issue and to stop using their service if i didn't like it. phenomenally unprofessional!!! this has happened on multiple occasions where an order is incorrect and it takes up to two weeks of emailing back and forth before i receive any form of compensation or apology, all the while the ""customer service"" representatives will send you disgustingly patronizing, condescending emails telling you why you're wrong and they're right (even though in the end, with multiple emails and lots of evidence demonstrating their mistake, they finally admit fault). this time, they refused to acknowledge fault and in so many words, told me to get lost. they would rather pocket your money illegally than retain a loyal paying customer. i will be switching to a competitor for food deliveries (probably uber eats - they're actually an organized company and they've never done me wrong) and will continue to inform everyone i know of this shady company who thrives only because of stealing money from their customers.",7/19/2017 19:05

i also had an order canceled after already waiting for it for a long time - and then was informed that even though the restaurant canceled my order, since they had already started making my food, i would be charged for it. when i tried to respond to the message, i got an auto reply stating i replied to an address that canÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â™t receive messages.

talkspace,"i am thankful to my therapist for being responsive, and checking in at least once a day. he was also respectful and professional. i did get 1-2 nuggets of useful advice. however, i found the therapy lacking in many ways and ultimately unhelpful. i was hoping for insight into my situations, but most responses i got were very basicÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â”either easily googled or common sense. still i was hopeful and wanted to give it a chance. i reiterated my goals with my therapist so he knew i wasnÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™t just here to vent, that i was looking for deeper understanding of what was going on. i continued to find the responses more of repetitions of what i said rather than anything i could learn from. i even tried nudging him in the right direction by suggesting possible explanations i learned from my own reading, hoping he would delve deeper. in response my therapist would agree with me and give a one sentence ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Âœelaboration.ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â i felt he was just trying to keep me happy and ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Âœfeeling heard,ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â but i couldnÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™t get much depth or new information from him. he honestly seemed to be trying his best but either through lack of skill/knowledge or the formatÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™s limitations, this therapy did not deliver. after a few weeks i found that answering the messages felt like a chore. i responded to the therapist just to get it off my to do list. i wasnÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™t getting anything useful from it.

 

btw, i was a little put off that i had to include an emergency contactÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™s full name and phone number. i had hoped for some anonymity due to the personal nature of things i would talk about. i tried to give just a first name, but he would not continue without a first and last name, and phone number. 

overall, from my experience i donÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™t think this format of therapy is going to help people looking for real therapy. the delay in response time (which to be fair, they warn you about) and that itÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™s written, makes it hard to connect or get deeper. not sure who this would work for? it really makes me wonder about the validity of some of these reviews.... if you want to pay $300+ a month for someone to read your texts and agree with you then sure. but i regret opening up about highly personal things and spending the money i did. i feel i can get better information googling mental health advice than from this.",5/18/2020 15:17

calm,this app requests constant location updates from the phone + ties it with your serial number and other identifiable information.  the website privacy policy says this information will be sold to third parties.... most users may be completely obvious to this and it's poor practice for dev to resort to tracking and selling location info about the user when it has nothing to do with service provided.,2/15/2015 8:34

talkspace,"deciding to try to get some help myself was a difficult decision. i badly wanted this to work out for me, but a lack of support from talkspace eventually left me in a worse place than when i started. 

talkspace fails on every promise made in the description. while it may be convenient to type out what youÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™re feeling in the app, this is effectively like yelling into a black hole. at no point did i feel confident that all my messages were read. there was no continuity on the responses that could ever constitute an actual conversation. the five or so total messages i received in the course of a week were just generalized patronization, with no thought or concern for anything i was actually trying to convey.

the service is in no way discrete of anonymous. youÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™ll be forced to provide details information on yourself, your location, and ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ÂœcontactsÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â or family members. this was a big deal for me and i feel like this was entirely misrepresented. 

and while the claim of affordable could be debated, it feels a lot more like outright robbery when you consider you may not actually being offered anything for your payment except someone pretending they read your messages before sending an underwhelming response every day or two.

the worst part of this service is no one is there to help you navigate the process. i asked for some direction from all the different people i spoke to when getting matched up with a therapist and from the therapist themselves, but no one actually provided any. i was told ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ÂœthereÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™s no wrong way to do thisÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â and other nonsensical information that eventually left me getting match up with someone that evidently didnÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™t even want to help. from there no direction left me lost as to what to do. i tried just typing out things that i though might be helpful, but then i just felt ignored. i asked for specific things i could type in and was told ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Âœjust put as much or as little about anything you want.ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â there was never any progress. i basically felt worse all the time, knowing i chose the service and kept paying for it, but was never receiving any help.

i gave a great effort to try to make this service work for me, i continued using (and paying) for multiple months, but putting in all my effort is sometimes mentally and physically exhausting, and i felt like no one ever cared if i tried or not. by the end the therapist just stopped talking to me. my last live session was never schedule. i submitted feedback multiple times indicating i felt there was no progress (they have you fill out multiple surveys as you go), but those, too, seemed to have lost to the void of talkspace. if i didnÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™t feel worthless before i stated i surely did by the time i decided i needed to cancel. and even after completing the cancelation form explaining why i wanted to cancel, weeks before my paid time was over, still no contact from anyone. i guess when they find out you wonÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™t be paying for future months no one has any interest in continuing to provide you the service youÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™ve already paid for.

if youÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™re really looking for some help, do your self a favor and just skip this app. iÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™m sure that thereÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™s some people that might find it helpful to just type out into the void, and get an ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Âœi hear youÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â or ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ÂœthatÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™s too badÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â response once a day, five days a week, from someone that may or may not have read anything you typed, but if youÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™re looking for anything else i donÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™t think youÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™ll find it in this app.

update: in case youÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™re wondering about these responses from the developer (there was one on mine 9 days after my initial review, not sure if it will remove it now that iÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™m updating) i did email them as requested. i waited almost 3 weeks now with no response. they were very quick to give anyone reading reviews the impression they have done legitimate concern if they had a bad experience, but just like every other message i sent while paying for this service, this email was never responded to. if they can spend the time responding to every negative review, but canÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™t talk to the people leaving the negative reviews, where are their priorities? apparently they only care about new subscribers, not actually helping anyone or addressing problems with their service.",10/31/2018 21:07

sanvello,"ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â°ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ÂŸÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â˜ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â  be aware: you must establish an account with pacifica in order to use this app....  
why?.... 
why am i compelled to hand over personal information just to see what a program offers? apps like this are offensive and intrusive, and although i have no idea what this app actually does, i am certain i don't want the intimate details of my behavioral quirks and struggles with depression to be neatly packaged for pacifica to sell...",9/22/2015 16:31
calm,great intro guided meditation but i don't understand why they need to collect and sell so much of my personal info (my imei # and location!?) when users are already paying real money for a subscription.,3/16/2019 17:42
talkspace,"the therapists on here seem overwhelmed and share way too much personal information. i am not exaggerating when i say that they might be able to use therapy themselves (we all could use some at various times in our lives). perhaps itÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™s due to covid and the sheer numbers of people requiring therapy, but my first therapist started off decent (although she mainly shared youtube links on mindfulness - i kid you not) then turned the tables and dumped all of her work and personal life struggles on me. this is not what a client wants to hear when seeking an avenue to work through his or her own stuff. therefore, i switched therapists, had to share all of my issues a second time (not sure why he couldnÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™t simply read the chat record), and he never responded once in two weeks after stating that he would once a day. i canceled my subscription but they really should be reimbursing me for the three months. i would not recommend this service to anyone. lesson learned. iÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™ll stick to traditional methods or practice mindfulness myself which has been working for me using insight timer.",12/15/2020 17:33
calm,"i didn't like that i had to agree to hand over alot of personal information 
wich might get handed over to 3rd party marketing. and this app has alot of 
5 star ""reviews"" without reviews and alot with the same short wording. not 
for me",7/1/2018 3:42
headspace,"you know what gives me stress? an app asking for a level of personal information that shouldn't be necessary. why do you all need my real full name? also after jumping through all the hoops, the only free music was ""lo-fi"". i hate ""lo-fi"". at least throw in some more variety for free users. the free level barely has anything, don't waste your time trying this out unless you are willing to open your wallets.",1/28/2021 8:56
headspace,i had to put personal info in but if i did i would probably like this app,1/31/2020 0:13
headspace,"trying to get in and run as a trial without providing personal info is 
impossible, gave new added anxiety. nice",5/28/2018 21:46
calm,don't install this application. because this application collects so many personal informations from your phone. please read terms and conditions before installing this app.,7/9/2021 22:07
calm,"asks questions about my stress, then asks for my personal info, further fueling my stress.",7/4/2021 11:44
calm,my personal information is none of your business. deleted.,6/21/2021 23:18
calm,you don't find out that you can't access anything unless you pay 70$ until after you give your personal information and create an account. i hate stuff like this. adds to your stress levels. read in another comment that if you keep the limited free version. you are bombarded with ads. i uninstalled in 10 min. extremely disappointed,5/11/2021 19:32
calm,shame on you scammers!! advertise it as free and after obtaining all personal information you ask for money!!! scammers.,4/27/2021 22:10
calm,"opened the app and clicked on different options and every single time it told me to try premium. if there are options to use without premium, make them available, otherwise don't tell people there are available options when they aren't. i wouldn't have downloaded it and given them my personal information in the first place.",4/21/2021 15:26
calm,"iÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™m rating this based on its listing as a free app. providing a paid app is totally fine when you are providing quality content- just be upfront about it. the approach of luring you in with a free app that asks for your personal info first, then tells you itÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™s a paid service after youÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™ve given your personal info feels dishonest.",2/24/2020 3:28

calm,it added my personal information without my permission,3/1/2021 1:41
calm,no sir. i don't like it. everything is locked. had to hit skip 100 times to get into it. just wanted to see what it was like without making an account. you can't do anything without giving them ur personal info. my alexa does more than this and is free after buying it.,2/20/2021 21:31
calm,"misleading pretense of this app did the opposite of calm me.    after getting you to disclose personal info, ie email, you are required to subscribe to continueÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â”with a recurring cost of $100 annually!    wanted to try because i needed help falling asleep and now iÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™m more worked up than before i opened this app.   scammy and ironic.",12/26/2019 6:10
calm,"this app says free, but after downloading and entering personal info, one single thing is available. i understand there are in app purchases, but there is nothing to try and inspire me to purchase, as there is nothing to listen to apart from one story. i basically gave them info for free ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â°ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ÂŸÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â·ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â°ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ÂŸÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ÂÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â»ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ÂÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â™ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€ÃƒÂ£Ã‚Â¯ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¸ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â kinda shady approach if you ask me.",6/22/2018 21:58
